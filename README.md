# Fioscope_3d_print_v1

This iteration of Fioscope is made to create an affordable, open-source, high-quality <b>digital stethoscope</b> accessible to everyone using 3D-printed, widely accessible parts, and your smartphone.
This Github repository contains all the 3D-printed files needed to make the 3D-printed part, as well as a list of all materials needed to create the 3D-printed Fioscope. Please visit our website https://fioscope.netlify.app/ for instructions on how to assemble your Fioscope and use the app.

NOTE: Our design is based on an existing open-source 3D-printed stehoscope created by Dr.Tarek Loubani. Please visit <a href="https://glia.org/"> The Glia Project</a> and their stethoscope<a href="https://github.com/GliaX/Stethoscope/"> github repository</a> for more info.
