# Fioscope_3d_print_v1

NOTE: Our design is based on an existing open-source 3D-printed stehoscope created by Dr.Tarek Loubani. Please visit <a href="https://glia.org/"> The Glia Project</a> for more info.

This iteration of Fioscope is made to create an affordable high-quality <b>digital stethoscope</b> accessible to everyone using 3D-printed and widely accessible parts.
This Github repository contains all the 3D-printed files needed to make the 3D-printed parts as well as a list of all materials needed to create the 3D-printed Fioscope. Please visit our website https://fioscope.netlify.app/ for instructions on how to assemble your stehoscope and use the app.
